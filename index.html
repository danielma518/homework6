        <p>Hong Kong is facing the challenge posed by rapidly aging population.
        It is appreciated that Hongkongers can have such high life expectancy but 
        we should consider the life quality.</p> 
        <p>Both female and male have <bold>higher</bold> life expectancy than before whereas low infant and maternal mortality rates continue.
        If aging population is growing with low birth rate, it will not only place a heavy 
        financial burden on the whole community, but also aggravate the social structure.</p>
